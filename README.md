## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned grid is not as easy as people make it look. I like it though.

### Continued development

As far as CSS goes, I want to continue focus on grid layouts. I chose this easier project to try it out and get my feet wet.

### Useful resources

- [Free: Learn CSS GRID with Wes Bos](https://cssgrid.io/) - This ended up being my starting point in learning css grid. I am still not finished the course because I thought I'd get more from it putting some of the earlier most basic material to use and getting practice until I am ready for more.
